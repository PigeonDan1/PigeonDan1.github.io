I am **Jing Peng (彭景)**, a Ph.D. student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, **X-LANCE Lab**, advised by **Prof. Kai Yu** (and co-advised by **Prof. Shinji Watanabe**).:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
My research focuses on **Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs)**, with an emphasis on building *well-aligned* speech understanding systems that are robust to domain shift and multi-speaker conditions.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Research Interests

- **Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs)** for speech understanding and reasoning:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Speaker-attributed ASR (SA-ASR)** and multi-speaker understanding (speaker discrimination, implicit speaker selection):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Multimodal alignment** between speech and text for instruction-following speech systems:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Efficient adaptation** (text-only fine-tuning, lightweight adapters) for low-resource / cross-domain settings:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

## Research Experience

My recent work spans both academic labs and industry research, centering on **ASR + LLM integration** and **alignment for speech understanding**:

- **Speech LLMs for Speech Understanding (AISpeech, Shanghai)**: I work on automatic speech recognition and multimodal alignment methods that connect speech representations with language model reasoning and instruction following.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **SA-ASR with Speech LLMs (Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Remote)**: I explore Speech LLM-based frameworks for *speaker-attributed transcription*, aiming to improve speaker consistency and controllability in multi-speaker scenarios.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Speaker Discrimination on Omni/SLM (Hi Lab, Xiaohongshu, Shanghai)**: I study explicit speaker discrimination and implicit speaker selection strategies for multi-speaker understanding, with an eye toward robust speaker identity modeling under real-world conditions.:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}   

## Personal

I am originally from **Hengyang, Hunan, China**. Outside of research, I enjoy **exploring local food** and **traveling**, and I am also an active fan of sports such as **badminton** and **basketball**.

If you are interested in my research directions, **feel free to reach out**—I am happy to discuss potential collaborations.
