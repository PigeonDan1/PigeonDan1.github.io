## Short Bio

I am **Jing Peng (彭景)**, a first year Zhiyuan Honor Ph.D. Student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, **[X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, advised by **[Prof. Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/~kaiyu/)** (and co-advised by **[Prof. Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe)**).

My research focuses on **Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs)**, with an emphasis on building **well-aligned speech understanding systems** that are robust to **domain shift** and **multi-speaker conditions**.

## Research Interests

Generally, I am focusing on **Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs)** for speech understanding and reasoning:

- **Speaker-attributed ASR (SA-ASR)** and multi-speaker understanding   
- **Multimodal alignment** between speech and text for instruction-following speech systems  
- **Efficient adaptation** (text-only fine-tuning, lightweight adapters) for low-resource / cross-domain settings  

---

## Research Experience

My recent work spans both academic labs and industry research:

- **Speech LLMs for Speech Understanding (AISpeech, Suzhou, Jiangsu)**  
  I work on ASR and multimodal alignment methods that connect speech representations with language model reasoning and instruction following.

- **SA-ASR with Speech LLMs (Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Remote)**  
  I explore Speech LLM-based frameworks for **speaker-attributed transcription**, aiming to improve **speaker consistency** and **controllability** in multi-speaker scenarios.

- **Speaker Discrimination on Omni/SLM (Hi Lab, Xiaohongshu, Shanghai)**  
  I study **explicit speaker discrimination** and **implicit speaker selection** strategies for multi-speaker understanding, with an eye toward robust speaker identity modeling under real-world conditions.
